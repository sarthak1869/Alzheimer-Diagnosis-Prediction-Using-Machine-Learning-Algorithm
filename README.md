Performance evaluation metrics

Visualization of model performance

# Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

# Dataset

The provided dataset is taken from kaggle website.

# Results

Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease detection using the provided dataset. The performance of each model was compared based on accuracy.

Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 71%

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) achieved an accuracy of 79%

Decision Tree and Random Forest models were also implemented to analyze model behavior and performance

Ensemble learning techniques such as AdaBoost and XGBoost were applied to improve prediction accuracy

Among all the models, XGBoost delivered the best performance with an accuracy of 81%, making it the most effective model for this task.
