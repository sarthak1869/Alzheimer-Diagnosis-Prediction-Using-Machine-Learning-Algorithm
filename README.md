# Alzheimer-Diagnosis-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm

# This project focuses on detecting Alzheimer’s disease using machine learning. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (Alzheimer_detection.ipynb) and leverages image processing and deep learning techniques to classify different stages of Alzheimer’s.

# Features

Data preprocessing and augmentation

Deep learning model (e.g., CNN)

Performance evaluation metrics

Visualization of model performance

# Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

# Dataset

The provided dataset is taken from kaggle website.

# Results

Succesfully implemented detection of Alzheimer's with the help of provided data and achieved an accuracy of 79% using KNN Algorithm and 70% accuracy using Logistic regression algorithm
